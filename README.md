# Insurance expenses prediction

In this repository are fitted multiple ML models to try to predict the policy holder insurance charges. The data was generated by of Brett Lantz base on the U.S. Census Bureau database.

This type of analysis are useful for insurance companies to improve their policy cost, to improve the policy holder costs and increase revenue to the company. In general, an insurance company needs to collect more in yearly premiums than it spends on medical care to its beneficiaries. As a result, insurers invest a great deal of time and money to develop models that accurately forecast medical expenses.

The main goal of this analysis is to use patient information to estimate the medical care expenses that could happen in the duration of the contract. Moreover, the estimators could be used to create actuarial tables that are also mandatory under the Solvency II framework.
